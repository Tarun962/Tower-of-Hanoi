# Tower-of-Hanoi

Hello Friends, this is my second Project.

You have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. 
The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascendingorder of size from top to bottom (i.e.,eachdisksitsontop of an even larger one).
You have the following constraints:(1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
                                   (2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower. 
                                   (3)A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk
